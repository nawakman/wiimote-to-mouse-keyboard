This script is made for FreePie

I connected the controller in bluetooth (small red button or 1 and 2 at the same time for search mode) (Nintendo RVL-CNT-01) from the config panel leaving the PIN code empty (in parameter it does not work, it is necessary to put a code) Then I looked for codes to use the Wii controller, I spent the whole morning trying to understand the code (still happy it's python otherwise I was not out) then i wrote my code and restarted the controller 15,000 times because it didn't work. In the end I succeeded, and it gives the code as an attachment (I tried to comment well what does what, open it from freePie) PS: It's a hassle to put in bluetooth, the controllers with the integrated wiimotionplus it does not work, and the controllers from a certain year either, nintendo does not like to share its peripherals PS2: once you have succeeded in connecting the controller, the LEDs will surely remain off, launch the script with F5 (shift F5 to stop) and then keep pressed on 1 and 2 until the controller vibrates, there will be a little time before you can control the mouse If it doesn't work, each time uninstall the Nintendo RVL-CNT-01 driver and try again (at first it didn't work, now it works every time, ¯ \ _ (ツ) _ / ¯) Normally I forgot nothing.
